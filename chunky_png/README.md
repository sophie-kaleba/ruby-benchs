These benchmarks are originally from JRuby Bench 9000.

We are using ChunkyPNG at revision `efd61c8d0ddcabdcf09fb44f8e8c1ba709995940`.
We use this old revision because we know it has interesting patterns of
meta-programming that we are interested in benchmarking. Some of these
patterns were replaced in later versions.

Only `ext/`, `lib/` and `LICENSE` are kept.

We've also applied this patch, to fix obvious bugs in keyword arguments which
limits optimisations.
